### Canine Convention

Our app is for dog owners who want to meet up with other dog owners to socialize. The Canine Convention is an app that allows owners to meet up with other nearby owners and their dogs to go on walks or to parks. A good reason for using this app is the chance for people to go out and connect with other pet-lovers (animal lovers), and improve their mental and social life. Other dog walking apps are focused solely on walking and donâ€™t allow for owners to meet up with others. Our app targets both walkers and those who prefer going to dog parks and also allows for owners to meet up with each other.
