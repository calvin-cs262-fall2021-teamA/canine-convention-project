## Canine Convention

Have you been looking for friends for your dog? How about fellow dog owner friends for yourself? Are you sick of walking your dog by yourself on the same path over and over again? We have a solution for you. We know that all dog owners want to keep their dog happy and healthy. The best ways to do that is to give them lots of time outside so they can get out their energy and interactions with other dogs, but this can be hard and unenjoyable to do on your own. This is where our app: Canine Convention can help. Canine Convention is an app that allows dog owners meet other dog owners and their dogs to socialize. Our app matches dog owners together based on similar interests so they can get together and go on a walk with their dogs or take them to a park so they can play together. Other apps only focus on going on walks with dogs and most are just for finding other people to walk your dog. Our app helps you connect with other local dog owners to explore new walking trails or the different dog parks in your area.
