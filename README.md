## Canine Convention

Have you ever been sitting around with your Dog and you say to your self "I want my Dog to have friends?" Well, we might have the solution. All Dog owners want their Dog to be happy but maybe they don't have enough resources to do it. The Canine Convention app allows dog owners to meet up with other dog owners so their pets can socialize. The idea is to match Dog owners together based on similar interests and get them to meet up for either a walk or even just go to the local dog park so their dogs can play. Other dog-walking apps are focused solely on dog walking and donâ€™t even give the option to meet up at other places. Other Dog walking apps are also solely focused on the owner but our app Targets both the Dog owner and the mental health of the Dog. Our app also targets both Dog walkers and those who prefer going to dog parks and also allows for owners to meet up with each other.
